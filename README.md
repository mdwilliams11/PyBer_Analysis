# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of the Analysis

In this module challenge we’re using ride share data for a presentation at “PyBer”. Using Python and the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries, we’ll analyze ride and city data. We’ll summarize the data and break it out by city type: Rural, Suburban, and Urban.

## Results

Urban rides account for the majority of overall rides, more than double the suburban number and 13 times as many rural rides. The total number of drivers and total fares follow a similar trend. The average fare per rider trends the opposite way, with rural fares being the highest on average.

Here is a dataframe with the summary of ride data broken out by rural, suburban, and urban cities:

Here is a graph showing the total fare per week broken out by the three city types:

We can see that the total fares for urban cities remains consistently higher than suburban and rural cities. The total fares for each city type remain relatively consistent week by week. There does not seem to be a noticeable seasonal trend for any of the three city types.



## Summary


- We should investigate whether or not the total number of drivers in rural areas is sufficient to service potential riders in those cities.

- We should consider charging more in urban cities or find another way to increase the average fare per driver.

- We should consider charging more or less for certain ride types during a small period of time as a test to see how the amount of rides and drivers change in response.
